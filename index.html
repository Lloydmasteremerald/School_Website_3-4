        School Socials

        It was great to have our first school Social in the new hall. Thanks to all the students, teachers and parents
        that made it a success. The students had a great time and the PTA raised a great sum of money for the school.
        The date of the term two disco has been confirmed for Thursday 22 June, 6-8pm.

        Chocolate Fundraiser

        We have our Chocolate fundraiser coming up in week three of term two starting with a school assembly on Monday 8
        May and the distribution of chocolates to all students on Friday 12 May. We would love to have more helpers to
        support the distribution of the chocolates that first week and each day starting from Monday 15 May from
        8.15-9am to receive chocolate money and give out more boxes at the same time.

        Next PTA Hui

        Our next meeting will be held in term 2, on Monday 1 May in the school library at 6pm. We hope to see you there!


        If you would like to help out at the next PTA social or chocolate fundraiser, please do contact us.

        We would love to hear from you, if you're interested in taking on the role of Chairperson, Secretary or
        Treasurer of the PTA next year. Please do contact us if you are able to help or have any questions:

        We are in the process of offering overseas travel options for our students between Saturday 9 September and
        returning no later than Friday 22 September.
        The destinations include Cairns, Japan and Singapore. Please have a talk with your young person and discuss if
        they might be interested.
        We are in the early stages of getting an expression of interest, at this stage, to get an understanding of the
        potential numbers attending each trip. Students can indicate
        if they are interested in more than one trip but will be required to put down their first and second
        preferences.
